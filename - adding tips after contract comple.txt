- adding tips after contract completion

indicate number of workable hours per days, workable days per week and number of weeks worked for each month

taskwatch disables once max workable hours has been exceeded..


5 days per week.. calculate on workable durations....



if the job is been declined, 
the employer should provide more reason why the clock-in was declined

- do not allow contract budget modified after acceptance... (done)

before contracts can be paused..
employers should confirm for already worked days or times...
